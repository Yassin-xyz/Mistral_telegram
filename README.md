# Mistral Telegram Integration
This Python script facilitates the connection between the Mistral Large Language Model (LLM) and a Telegram application.
It captures user requests from Telegram, forwards them to the Mistral API for processing, and returns the responses back to the user.

To set up this integration, you will need to provide your Telegram bot ID and Mistral API token through environment variables.
